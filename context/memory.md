# Memory — software-factory decision log

Entry format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title`, then `Category: Decision | Preference | System change | Context`, then 1–3 sentences. Mark superseded entries clearly and number durable decisions within this repository.

## Current truth

- This repository is a product-agnostic factory kit; product repositories carry only their factory state and CI integration.
- Durable decisions in this repository use their own numbering, beginning at Decision 1.
- Backend fallback is pre-execution selection: production stays OpenAI-family, checking stays Anthropic-family, and one logical role run submits its task to at most one agent process.
- Stable product and operating truth lives under `docs/`; executable prompts, copied templates, conformance evidence, and vendored material remain colocated with their consumers.
- The repository adopts Nysa Agents baseline v3 as a toolkit with repository, secret, artifact, Git-flow, CI, config-review, and full local PR gates enabled. The canonical verification command is `bash ci/test-all.sh`.

## Log

## 2026-07-13 — Decision 1: Repository-local decision numbering

Category: Decision

Software Factory decisions are numbered independently from Nysa product decisions. This keeps reusable tooling history separate from product history.

## 2026-07-13 — Decision 2: Family-typed Cursor fallback

Category: System change

Codex remains the production primary and Claude Code the checking primary. Optional Cursor adapters preserve those provider families and may be selected only by non-task probes before reservation and task submission; every post-submission failure stops without automatic retry.

## 2026-07-14 — Decision 3: Baseline v3 and durable documentation routing

Category: System change

Durable documentation was centralized under `docs/` and mechanically checked during PR readiness and CI. Plugin AI review is a pre-publication gate for changes to this kit; the factory's independent Reviewer, Narrator evidence bundle, and human approval remain authoritative for product tickets.
